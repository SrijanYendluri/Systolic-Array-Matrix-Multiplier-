## *"A 4x4 7-bit systolic array multiplier on FPGA, verified with a UVM-inspired Python testbench over UART (Basys3)."*

---

## The Project 
- An external matrix multiplication accelerator (systolic array) in SystemVerilog for Basys3 fpga
- UVC for the MAC unit with functonal coverage based verification (Reached 100% in 1.33 min and 163345 transactions)
- A Python driver that sends data via UART, triggers computation, and reads the result back as Python arrays
- A UVM-inspired testbench in Python that automatically generates test cases, runs them on the FPGA, and verifies the output against golden results generated by NumPy

### Folders 
- matmul_acclerator (Vivado project folder)
  - Run the vivado file to directly open the proj
  - there is Bitstream file already generated that works on BASYS3 only
- Design file
  - All the .sv and constraint files seperately provided
  - mac_UVC
    -  EDA Playground : https://edaplayground.com/x/ZJis
    -  .sv files also avaliable for the UVC
    -  Test bench achieve 100% functional coverage in 1.33 min and 163345 transactions  
- Test_Bench.py
  - run this once the FPGA is ready and comports are connected    
- fpga_frimware.py
  - import this into another ptoject to use the fpga for computation
- example_use.py
  - clean example to show you how it works

Since this is an active personal project it is only 4X4 matrix and only 8 bits for now I aim to impliment more complex protocols as I learn.
